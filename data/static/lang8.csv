Yesterday I finished restoring 116 journal comments that were posted and lost between 16:00 Nov 1st - 3:00 Nov 2nd (UTC) , from a backup data and server logs.
About the update related troubles
Thank you very much for your continued supports on Lang-8.
We are also going to announce some big new features in next couple of weeks.
We will fix the problem soon as possible.
Click on the icon appeared below each journal comment and you can tag them to your own Notebook.
Tonight we had a minor renewal in the Notebook feature.
It may be take time to implement all of them, but we will continue doing our best to satisfy all requests.
We are also paying notice on another requests about Notebook posted on the FeatureRequest page.
So, why don't you TAG IT & KEEP IT to your own Notebook for further studying.
I'm Kazuki.

Minor renewal in the Notebook feature
We are also paying notice on another requests about Notebook posted on the FeatureRequest page.
The Notebook feature let you easily review those worthful notes.
So, why don't you TAG IT & KEEP IT to your own Notebook for further studying.
As some of our users say in the FeatureRequest page, journal comments we receive are sometimes full of wisdoms and of great value.
Any request?
Do you remember "feature request page"?
Now its fixed.
We are very sorry for everyone who got annoyed at this problem.
Also it is able to hide your notebook from other users if you want.
With your helps, the feature will make it easier to discover new language knowledge!
Today we're announcing a new feature named "My Notebook", where you can collect and clip useful correction posts from your journal entries or some others entries, review them for your own learnings.
kazuki,
We hope the feature will make Lang-8 even better, joyful place to all Lang-8 users.
The maximum limit of tag number is 8 by each entry so you are supporsed to have up to 4 kinds of tags.
Since your entries are of great worth to two groups of Lang-8 users(people who study your naitive language and people who study the language same as you),  you are recommended to tag keywords in 2 languages just as I did in this entry.
I'm kazuki.
Just select one from the pulldown menu so that you can show which language you want people to help yourself with.
Also,you can read latest journal entries written in your mother language from "See the latest journal entries that are awaiting your corrections" in "My Home".
While you write your posts, it comes out above journal title form.
Today we implemented "Language flag" feature to Journal.
Thank you for useing Lang-8.

Just check "Post this entry to Facebook, then you can post your entry's summally to your Facebook wall as well as to post to Twitter from Lang-8.
The amazing thing is that I have a habit to delete my tweets without knowing it.
I want to keep good condition and work longer asap, so I don't want to exhaust my power and time with unmeaningful things.

In Japan there is a funny tradition called "White day" on March 14th.

Of course, it is nothing to do with me...(｀；ω；´) 
Usually they have to buy a preset 3 times higher than the chocolate they received.

In Japan there is a funny culture that girls give chocolate to guys.
I was interviewed by a media at end of last Year.

people attend college or university for many different reasons, I believe that three common reasons are to get new experience, to prepare career for the future, and to increase knowledge.

They can make speaking the language seem very sophisticated and at the same time, easy to understand.
I think the best way to test if a person has mastered a language or not is to see how that person can make speaking a language a form of art in daily life.
For example, when someone asked me excitedly "Have you met my little sister?", I simply treated it as a yes/no question and gave a straight "no" and followed with "I didn't".
I think I will write at least 1 entry everyday, and because the best way to improve something is make mistakes, then I have you to correct me, that will make me better at English :)

From my  view,stress is just like a serious and strict teacher who frighten you as well as help you to make progress.
It just like the tigger named Thirsty who accompanies Pie floating on the sea, without the fear and vigilance to it,Pie may have died already.
They think all socitey can benefit from stress.
They take it as a method to inspire and urge themselves.
How stress,which someone is deeply afraid of,whereas others think has benefis,influence our lives?
Sometimes stress will become a devil ,so much so that even frighten people to commit suicide.

They justify it by saying that friendship is not a constant relationship, because friends change during life, and there is no sense in holding on them.

Get distracted from your fear!
