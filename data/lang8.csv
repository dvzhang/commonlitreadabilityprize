Yesterday I finished restoring 116 journal comments that were posted and lost between 16:00 Nov 1st - 3:00 Nov 2nd (UTC) , from a backup data and server logs.
About the update related troubles
Thank you very much for your continued supports on Lang-8.
We are also going to announce some big new features in next couple of weeks.
We will fix the problem soon as possible.
Click on the icon appeared below each journal comment and you can tag them to your own Notebook.
Tonight we had a minor renewal in the Notebook feature.
It may be take time to implement all of them, but we will continue doing our best to satisfy all requests.
We are also paying notice on another requests about Notebook posted on the FeatureRequest page.
So, why don't you TAG IT & KEEP IT to your own Notebook for further studying.
I'm Kazuki.
Thank you for always supporting Lang-8.

Minor renewal in the Notebook feature
We are also paying notice on another requests about Notebook posted on the FeatureRequest page.
The Notebook feature let you easily review those worthful notes.
So, why don't you TAG IT & KEEP IT to your own Notebook for further studying.
As some of our users say in the FeatureRequest page, journal comments we receive are sometimes full of wisdoms and of great value.
Any request?
Do you remember "feature request page"?
Now its fixed.
We are very sorry for everyone who got annoyed at this problem.
Also it is able to hide your notebook from other users if you want.
With your helps, the feature will make it easier to discover new language knowledge!
Today we're announcing a new feature named "My Notebook", where you can collect and clip useful correction posts from your journal entries or some others entries, review them for your own learnings.
kazuki,
We hope the feature will make Lang-8 even better, joyful place to all Lang-8 users.
The maximum limit of tag number is 8 by each entry so you are supporsed to have up to 4 kinds of tags.
Since your entries are of great worth to two groups of Lang-8 users(people who study your naitive language and people who study the language same as you),  you are recommended to tag keywords in 2 languages just as I did in this entry.
I'm kazuki.
Just select one from the pulldown menu so that you can show which language you want people to help yourself with.
Also,you can read latest journal entries written in your mother language from "See the latest journal entries that are awaiting your corrections" in "My Home".
While you write your posts, it comes out above journal title form.
Today we implemented "Language flag" feature to Journal.
Thank you for useing Lang-8.
I didnt know that the access to drafts had been broken up.
Couple of hours ago we received a bug report that saved message drafts cannot be accessed anymore.
We made the Smartphone web site three times faster than before it was.
I think I can't live in Europe, maybe.
A designer has joined our team since April, so we've changed Lang-8's design a lot.
Just check "Post this entry to Facebook, then you can post your entry's summally to your Facebook wall as well as to post to Twitter from Lang-8.
The amazing thing is that I have a habit to delete my tweets without knowing it.
I want to keep good condition and work longer asap, so I don't want to exhaust my power and time with unmeaningful things.
I don't know how about in other countries.
In Japan there is a funny tradition called "White day" on March 14th.
There is a another tradition on Valentine's day.
White day is the day that boys give a present to a girl who gave a chocolate to him.
Usually they have to buy a preset 3 times higher than the chocolate they received.
Of course, it is nothing to do with me...(｀；ω；´) 
Usually they have to buy a preset 3 times higher than the chocolate they received.
I don't know what should I speak such a long time.
I will also talk at Waseda University more than 1 hour another day.
I will talk at Tokyo University this Saturday.
In Japan there is a funny culture that girls give chocolate to guys.
I was interviewed by a media at end of last Year.
We also want to know how Lang-8 users think about and use Lang-8.
The main purpose of this event is communicate with other Lang-8 users at offline.
Long time no seen.=^-^=
